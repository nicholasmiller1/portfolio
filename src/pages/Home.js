                          Hi, I'm Nicholas Miller â€” a full-stack software engineer with experience in numerous frameworks and languages. 
                          I earned my B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Virginia along with a minor in Engineering Business. 
                          I am an avid learner who is always seeking to learn new things, expand my skill set, and sate my curiosity. 
                          As such, I often explore exciting concepts that tackle new areas of software engineering by engaging in my own personal 
                          projects. These have been in a variety of disciplines ranging from AI to 3D graphics to robotics and I love watching my ideas come to life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Outside of software, I also enjoy a number of other hobbies including rock climbing, archery,
                          and videogames.
                        </p>
