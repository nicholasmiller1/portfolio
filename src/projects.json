        "description": "Using the Java Processing API, I rebuilt the classic game of Tetris from scratch. I then created an AI program to play the game as well as possible. The AI uses a modified A-star graph algorithm to generate all the possible end positions of a piece and the paths to them, then chooses the best position based on a collection of factors.",

I was then able to use this data to determine the orientation and position of the joycon in 3D space and visualize it. In the future, I want to reprogram my current progress in C++ to improve performance then try to interface with the joycon directly without an external library.",

The app uses web socket connections through SocketIO to connect players online and is able to support multiple rooms simultaneously. This allows different players to play separate lobbies and games at the same time. <br/><br/>The live website can be found <a href='https://multiplayer-online-gamepack.herokuapp.com/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>here</a>",

The program searches through a large dictionary file and calculates the current best guess dependent on a regex string generated from known letters and failed guesses.",

The visualization takes the form of a series of rotating vectors whose tip draws out the path. In the future, I hope to enable the program to directly take in svg files and generate the path itself to perform a fourier transform on.",

We built an app that pulled hospital price data from a large database we gathered and allowed users to compare prices among different hospitals and services according to a variety of criteria. If a given a particular hospital's price data is not found in our database, we added a feature for user's to upload a csv file containing a hospital's price data (now required to be accessible in the U.S.) to our database for comparison. <br/><br/>The hackathon devpost can be found <a href='https://devpost.com/software/hospital-app' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>here</a>.",
